# example

This example project shows some basic usages of the `tinycolor2` package. 

## Run project

### In your favourite  IDE
Open `tinycolor2/example` in your favourite IDE and run it from there. While `tinycolor2`
has not been migrated to null-safety, run it with the option `--no-sound-null-safety`.

### From terminal
Navigate to `tinycolor2/example` in a terminal, then run:
1. `flutter pub get`
2. `flutter run --no-sound-null-safety` (no-sound-null-safety option is needed until `tinycolor2` 
supports null-safety)
